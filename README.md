# UART-Verilog-project-
This project implements a Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART)  transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) using Verilog HDL.
##  Design Description
- TX converts parallel 8-bit data into serial data format.
- RX samples serial input data and reconstructs parallel data.
- Finite State Machines (FSM) are used for TX and RX control.
- Baud rate generator is implemented using clock counters.
 ## ▶️ How to Simulate
This design was simulated using EDA Playground (online simulator).

Steps:
1. Upload RTL and testbench files to EDA Playground.
2. Select a Verilog simulator.
3. Run simulation and observe waveform/output.
